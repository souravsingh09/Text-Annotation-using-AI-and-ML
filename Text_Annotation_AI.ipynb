       "'1 INDICATIONS AND USAGETherapy with lipid-altering agents should be only one component of multiple risk factor intervention in individuals at significantly increased risk for atherosclerotic vascular disease due to hypercholesterolemia. Drug therapy is recommended as an adjunct to diet when the response to a diet restricted in saturated fat and cholesterol and other nonpharmacologic measures alone has been inadequate. In patients with CHD or multiple risk factors for CHD, atorvastatin calcium tablets can be started simultaneously with diet.1.1 Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease in AdultsIn adult patients without clinically evident coronary heart disease, but with multiple risk factors for coronary heart disease such as age, smoking, hypertension, low HDL-C, or a family history of early coronary heart disease, atorvastatin calcium tablets are indicated to:•Reduce the risk of myocardial infarction          •Reduce the risk of stroke          •Reduce the risk for revascularization procedures and angina          In adult patients with type 2 diabetes, and without clinically evident coronary heart disease, but with multiple risk factors for coronary heart disease such as retinopathy, albuminuria, smoking, or hypertension, atorvastatin calcium tablets are indicated to:•Reduce the risk of myocardial infarction          •Reduce the risk of stroke          In adult patients with clinically evident coronary heart disease, atorvastatin calcium tablets are indicated to:•Reduce the risk of non-fatal myocardial infarction          •Reduce the risk of fatal and non-fatal stroke          •Reduce the risk for revascularization procedures          •Reduce the risk of hospitalization for CHF          •Reduce the risk of angina          1.2 HyperlipidemiaAtorvastatin calcium tablets are indicated•As an adjunct to diet to reduce elevated total-C, LDL-C, apo B, and TG levels and to increase HDL-C in adult patients with primary hypercholesterolemia (heterozygous familial and nonfamilial) and mixed dyslipidemia (    Fredrickson Types IIa and IIb);   •As an adjunct to diet for the treatment of adult patients with elevated serum TG levels (    Fredrickson Type IV);   •For the treatment of adult patients with primary dysbetalipoproteinemia (    Fredrickson Type III) who do not respond adequately to diet;   •To reduce total-C and LDL-C in patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH) as an adjunct to other lipid-lowering treatments (e.g., LDL apheresis) or if such treatments are unavailable;•As an adjunct to diet to reduce total-C, LDL-C, and apo B levels in pediatric patients, 10 to 17 years of age, with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HeFH) if after an adequate trial of diet therapy the following findings are present: \\t    •LDL-C remains = 190 mg/dL or•LDL-C remains = 160 mg/dL and:•there is a positive family history of premature cardiovascular disease or•two or more other CVD risk factors are present in the pediatric patient1.3 Limitations of UseAtorvastatin calcium tablets have not been studied in conditions where the major lipoprotein abnormality is elevation of chylomicrons (   Fredrickson Types I and V).

(a- and   ss-hemolytic isolates only), Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus spp., or Haemophilus influenzae. 1.2 Infections of the Genitourinary TractAmoxicillin capsules are indicated in the treatment of infections due to susceptible (ONLY ss-lactamase-negative) isolates of Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, or Enterococcus faecalis. 1.3 Infections of the Skin and Skin StructureAmoxicillin capsules are indicated in the treatment of infections due to susceptible (ONLY ss-lactamase-negative) isolates of Streptococcus spp. (a- and ss-hemolytic isolates only), Staphylococcus spp., or E. coli. 1.4 Infections of the Lower Respiratory TractAmoxicillin capsules are indicated in the treatment of infections due to susceptible (ONLY ss-lactamase-negative) isolates of Streptococcus spp. (a- and ss-hemolytic isolates only), S. pneumoniae, Staphylococcus spp., or H. influenzae. 1.5 Helicobacter pylori Infection Triple therapy for Helicobacter pylori with clarithromycin and lansoprazole: Amoxicillin capsules in combination with clarithromycin plus lansoprazole as triple therapy, is indicated for the treatment of patients with H. pylori infection and duodenal ulcer disease (active or 1-year history of a duodenal ulcer) to eradicate H. pylori. Eradication of H. pylori has been shown to reduce the risk of duodenal ulcer recurrence. Dual therapy for H. pylori with lansoprazole : Amoxicillin capsules, in combination with lansoprazole delayed-release capsules as dual therapy, is indicated for the treatment of patients with H. pylori infection and duodenal ulcer disease (active or 1-year history of a duodenal ulcer) who are either allergic or intolerant to clarithromycin or in whom resistance to clarithromycin is known or suspected. (See the clarithromycin package insert, MICROBIOLOGY.) Eradication of H. pylori has been shown to reduce the risk of duodenal ulcer recurrence. 1.6 UsageTo reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of amoxicillin capsules and other antibacterial drugs, amoxicillin capsules should be used only to treat infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy. ',\n",

When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.Nitrofurantoins lack the broader tissue distribution of other therapeutic agents approved for urinary tract infections. Consequently, many patients who are treated with nitrofurantoin monohydrate/macrocrystals capsules are predisposed to persistence or reappearance of bacteriuria. (See CLINICAL STUDIES.) Urine specimens for culture and susceptibility testing should be obtained before and after completion of therapy. If persistence or reappearance of bacteriuria occurs after treatment with nitrofurantoin monohydrate/macrocrystals capsules, other therapeutic agents with broader tissue distribution should be selected. In considering the use of nitrofurantoin monohydrate/macrocrystals capsules, lower eradication rates should be balanced against the increased potential for systemic toxicity and for the development of antimicrobial resistance when agents with broader tissue distribution are utilized.''')"
